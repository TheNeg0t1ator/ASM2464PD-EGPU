# ASM2464PD-test
I wanted to know more about the new Asmedia USB4 chips because I want to make USB-C PCIe stuff.

The ASM2464PD is meant for USB4 (or Thunderbolt 3 and USB3.x too, afaik) to NVMe SSD enclosures, and the ASM2464PDX is meant for USB4/TB to general PCIe devices such as GPUs.  
I've read that the PD one also works for general PCIe devices but it's not officially supported.

So anyway I found some sussy data online and made a kicad version of the ASM2464PD pcb footprint and schematic symbol, it's a start to figuring out how to DIY something with these chips. No datasheet tho :/  
Maybe it's useful for someone
